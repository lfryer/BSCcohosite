				<h3>We have BIG NEWS!!</h3>

					<li>
						<p class="text">
							Bay State Commons cohousing has just signed an Option to Purchase agreement for the American Legion site at 368 Pleasant Street in Malden! Malden was named "Best Place to Raise Your Kids" in Massachusetts by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2009. The site is 750 feet from the Malden T stop, 20 minutes to downtown Boston. It is a short walk to groceries, public and charter schools, restaurants, and public parks. It is 1 mile from the Middlesex Fells, a 2,200 acre state park.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							Our next steps are to formally evaluate the site's suitability for our project, starting a title search and environmental and soil quality evaluations, then moving on to detailed engineering, financial, and local permitting assessments.  We will also be hiring an architect to design our future common space, and our homes.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							If youâ€™ve been thinking about cohousing, now is the time to seriously check out Bay State Commons.  We will be holding an open meeting soon to share more of our plans.
						</p>
