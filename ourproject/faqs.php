	<p class="query" id="q1">1. Where will the community be?</p>
	<p class="text">So far our top choices for location are Arlington and Medford; if we do not find a suitable site in those towns, we will move on to Melrose and Malden.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q2">2. Will you consider other towns? I know about an awesome piece of land in town X...</p>
	<p class="text">At the moment, no. Our community was created with the intention of being located in Bostons' metro-north area. If our site search does not turn up any usable land in our selected towns, we may reconsider to preserve the health of the project, but that will only happen as a last resort.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q3">3. Are you a commune?</p>
	<p class="text">Nope. Communes tend to be ideologically based, and have a shared economy of some sort. We are a non-ideological community and we do not share income.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q4">4. Will I have input into the design of Bay State Commons?</p>
	<p class="text">That depends on when you join, and how deeply involved you become. We have three levels of membership: prospective, associate, and equity. Each level has different rights and responsibilities, which are determined by how much someone has invested in the project - both time and money. Equity member joining the project early on will have a lot of impact on the design of the community; associate members who join towards the end, not as much.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q5">5. What is the contribution level/timeline like?</p>
	<p class="text">Bay State Commons starts requiring contributions at the associate membership level. Becoming an associate member requires a $250 contribution, as well as two semi-annual payments of $250. Becoming an equity member requires an initial contribution of $5000. The idea behind this is that by the time we all move in, everyone's contributions will eventually become the down payments on our units.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q6">6. What will the unit price be?</p>
	<p class="text">At this point we are aiming for an <b>average</b> unit price of $400,000. This is an estimate. Units will be different sizes, and some will be more or less expensive accordingly.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q7">7. What is the project timeline?</p>
	<p id="indents">2014 - Membership drive, land search, financial organization
	<br>2015 - Intensified land search, continued membership drive
	<br>2016 - Community planning and design, break ground, build
	<br>2017 - Move in!</p>

	<p class="query" id="q8">8. How do you make decisions as a group?</p>
	<p class="text">We employ consensus decision making. This style of decision making requires the consent of all households to a decision rather than a simple majority vote. </p>
	<p class="centersmall"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
	<p class="query" id="q9">9. That sounds like a horribly inefficient way to make decisions, what if you cannot reach consensus?</p>
	<p class="text">We find this style works quite well. Consensus allows us to make decision that we can all abide by, rather than out-voting a minority. If we cannot come up with an answer that we can all live with, it means that we must rethink our decision and come up with a solution that more elegantly fits our community.</p>

	<p class="query" id="q10">10. Why should I join BSC and not cohousing community X?</p>
	<p class="text">If you want to live in the metro north area of Boston with a small town feel, and be part of an amazing community of diverse people, that is us.</p>
