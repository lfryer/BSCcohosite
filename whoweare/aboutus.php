    <p class="text">We are a group of professionals living and working in the Boston area. 
    We have scientists, artists, writers, and we are all enthusiastically geeky about many different things. 
    We intend to start an intentional community that reflects our values, where we can create a chosen family with each other. 
    Currently, we are hoping to find new people who share our vision and are interested in becoming involved in cohousing.</p>
